Hi! I'm Elena and I'm passionate about data. I'm drawn to data science and machine learning because I love finding insights and patterns in good old numbers. My academic background is in Computer Science and I'm currently looking to work in business intelligence and analytics. I have experience in data analytics working in the analysis of ultrasonic sensor data to provide insights of water consumption behaviour. I like working in Python, R and have recently learned adopted Microsoft Power BI in my toolkit.
